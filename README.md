# Booking & Appointment Platform Prompt for Cursor

## Project Overview

Build a **Booking & Appointment Platform** web application using **Flask** and **JavaScript**.

The platform should allow users to:

- View available time slots for services (e.g., salons, clinics, consultants)
- Book appointments easily and receive booking confirmations via email
- Admin users can view a calendar of bookings and reschedule appointments

---

## Frontend Requirements

- Theme: **Green and white** as primary colors, with a touch of **red** for highlights or alerts
- Include **cool CSS animations** for buttons, transitions, and interactive elements
- Responsive design that works well on desktop and mobile
- Smooth user experience with loading indicators and animated feedback

---

## Backend Requirements

- Use **Flask** as the backend framework
- Manage appointments and user data with a simple database (SQLite or any preferred)
- Provide REST API endpoints for:
  - Fetching available time slots
  - Creating new bookings
  - Viewing and rescheduling appointments (admin)
- Implement basic authentication for admin users

---

## Email Notifications

- Use **Google Gmail API** to send booking confirmation emails to users
- Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure Gmail access (request `gmail.send` scope)
- Emails should confirm appointment details clearly
- Gmail API usage is free with generous quotas, but requires handling user consent securely

---

## Additional Notes

- Modular and maintainable code structure for easy customization per client
- Clear user instructions and error handling on frontend and backend
- Admin dashboard with calendar view for managing appointments visually

---

## Summary

Create a modern, user-friendly booking platform with:

- Green/white/red themed animated frontend  
- Flask backend with secure APIs and Gmail API email notifications  
- Easy admin management of appointments  

This project demonstrates skills in **fullstack web development, API integration, OAuth authentication, and UX/UI design**.

If needed, please help generate code snippets for:

- Google Gmail API OAuth flow and email sending in Flask  
- Animated CSS components for buttons and calendar UI  
- REST API design for bookings and appointment management
